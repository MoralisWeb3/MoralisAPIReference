# Moralis Introduction

## What is Moralis?

Think **Firebase of crypto**. Moralis provides managed backend for blockchain projects. Automatically syncing the balances of your users into the database, allowing you to set up on-chain alerts, watch smart contract events, build indexes, and so much more. All features are accessed through an easy-to-use SDK. All features Moralis provides are cross-chain by default ðŸ¤¯.

## Why use Moralis?

Moralis is the fastest way to build and deploy dApps on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, and Elrond (more coming). All Moralis dApps are cross-chain by default. Building on Moralis ensures that your dApp is future-proof. Even if new blockchains are invented, your dApp will instantly work on any chain.

Whether you are building your first blockchain project or are already a seasoned developer - Moralis will make your projects easier to build, maintain and improve.

The video below explains more in-depth what Moralis is and how it helps your project.

### The Moralis SDK

Moralis' SDK is how we tie all of this together. Our JavaScript SDK is how your dApp interacts with your Moralis Server. Using the SDK, you can authenticate users, either through username and password or through a crypto wallet like MetaMask You can also use the SDK to get and set user data to fetch balances, NFTs, events, or transactions.

You can read more about the SDK by[ clicking here](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-dapp/connect-the-sdk/connect-with-js).
